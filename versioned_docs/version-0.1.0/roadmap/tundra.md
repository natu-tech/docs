# Tundra

![Tundra era](/img/tundra.png)

The first era **is entirely to establish the foundations of Natu**. Therefore, the research and development will focus on preparing Natu for the future stages. This includes the creation of the Natu conservation network by joining the first parks in Chile. The team will also work on creating the technological infrastructure to carry Natu into the coming eras.

## Tundra work scope

- [ ] Integrate the first 5,000 hectares to the **Natu Conservation Network**.
- [ ] Generate a rationale for **Natu Inprovement Proposals(NIPs)**.
- [ ] Implement the smart contracts for **minting \$NATU**.
- [ ] Implement the smart contracts for **minting Conservation Units** (COUNs).
- [ ] Implement an **API to track the state of each COUN** in the network.
- [ ] Conect the smart contracts with the API through a Chainlink **oracle**.
- [ ] Generate a **demo of the natuverse**.
- [ ] Create the **course crypto 101** for both final users and park owners.
