# Biome

![Biome era](/img/biome.png)


The main milestone of the Biome era is to have **100,000 conservation units in the conservation network**. So the team will focus on scaling the ecosystem by launching the natuverse in the NEAR mainnet, developing a SDK, adding new features, and promoting the adoption.

## Biome work scope

### Natu conservation network

In the Biome era, the **team will focus on joining new parks around the world**. This poses the challenge of dealing in many different jurisdictions, so Natu will promote alliances to address these potential risks.

At this point we expect to be one of the most distributed, decentralized and largest conservation networks in the world.

### Next roadmap

The Biome era is just the beginning of the project. **Natu will establish the next stages of the roadmap through chain voting events**.

At this point we expect to be one of the largest and most decentralized networks in the cryptospace.
