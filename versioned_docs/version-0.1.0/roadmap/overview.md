# Welcome to the Natu Roadmap

The Natu roadmap guides the development of the project over time. **The roadmap is organized into sequential eras**. Each era will provide a set of new features, research, and proposals through documentation and multiple code releases.

The eras in Natu shows a sequence, but the work of each era can occur at the same time. In fact, the research, the prototyping, and the development of some eras will normally advance in parallel.
