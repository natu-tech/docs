# Desert


![Desert era](/img/desert.png)

The Desert era comes after the Tundra. Here, the team will focus on the development of decentralized green loans, which is the first use case for $NATU.

## Desert work scope

### Natu conservation network

Now is the time to expand the Natu conservation network to more ecosystems in different countries. In the era of the Desert, our goal is to include parks outside of Chile.

### Natuverse

In the Desert era **our goal is to launch the natuverse in the NEAR mainnet**. This must include a NFT marketplace in the first cryptown, so the team will develop the functionality to make the natuverse usable.

At the same time, the team will develop all the functions to make the natuverse a serious player in the market.

### Adoption strategy

**We will create our conservation 101 course** to promote good nature conservation practices among the community. The course will have two versions, one for potential users and one for park owners.

We will also continue to position the brand among the community, but now focusing on a broader Latin American audience.
