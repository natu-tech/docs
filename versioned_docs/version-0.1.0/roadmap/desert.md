# Desert


![Desert era](/img/desert.png)

The era of the Desert comes after the Tundra. Here, the team will be completely focussed to the development of NatuChain and the monitoring algorithm. 

## Desert work scope

### Natu conservation network

Now is the time to expand the Natu conservation network to more ecosystems in different countries. In the era of the Desert, our goal is to include parks outside of Chile.

### Natu core protocol

In the era of the Desert **our goal is to implement the smart contracts for minting the conservation units and the \$NATU token in the NEAR mainnet**.

Also we aim to integrate new parks automatically to the natuverse for increasing the scalability.

### Natuverse

In the Desert era **our goal is to launch the natuverse in the NEAR mainnet**. This must include a NFT marketplace in the first natutown, so the team will develop the functionality to make the natuverse usable.
