# Marine

![Desert era](/img/marine.png)

At this point, the blockchain is in its early stages and there are few validators nodes in the network. So in the Marine era **our goal is to integrate as many validators as possible to achieve true decentralization**. This era also involves the creation of the community DAO.

At the same time, the team will develop all the remaining functions to launch the Mainet. 

## Marine work scope

### Natu conservation network

At this moment there are some parks in the network that are being rewarded with \$NATU. Is the time to create a business case for onboarding institutional investors.

In the era of the Desert, **our objective is to continue incorporating private landowners and communities, but also institutional investors** through alliances with real estate companies.

### Core protocol

It is time to test and create the first dApps that run on NatuChain. This is a crucial moment for the project because great usability means great adoption in the future.

**Our goal is to provide a software development kit (sdk) that enables developers to easily create and deploy their dApps in the NatuChain**. 


### Natuverse

The natuverse is expanding as a reflect of the growth of the Natu conservation network. At Marine era **our goal is to incorporate the first game and marketplace inside the natuverse**.

### NatuDAO

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are one of the most complex smart contracts. Like other DAOs on the market, NatuDAO is a tool that provides transparency in the decisions that affect the project. In fact, the NatuDAO will finance and promote projects through a decentralized voting mechanism, so it is crucial to achieve a real decentralization. 

In the Marine era, **our goal is to design the NatuDAO protocol and implement the smart contracts necessary for its operation**.
