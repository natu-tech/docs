# Marine

![Marine era](/img/marine.png)

At this point, the natuverse is in its early stages and there are few parks in the network. So in the Marine era **our goal is to integrate as many parks as possible to achieve true decentralization**. This era also involves the creation of the community DAO.

At the same time, the team will develop all the remaining functions to make the natuverse a serious player in the market. 

## Marine work scope

### Natu conservation network

At this moment there are some parks in the network that are being rewarded with \$NATU. Is the time to create a business case for onboarding institutional investors.

In the Marine era, **our objective is to continue incorporating private park owners and communities, but also institutional investors** through alliances with real estate companies.

### Natu core protocol

It is time to promote and integrate the first dApps in the natuverse. This is a crucial moment for the project because great usability means great adoption in the future.

**Our goal is to provide a software development kit (sdk) that enables developers to easily create and deploy their dApps**. 

In parallel the team will start to research how to decentralize the hardware to lower costs and increase adoption.

### Natuverse

The natuverse is expanding as a reflect of the growth of the Natu conservation network. At Marine era **our goal is to incorporate the first games and expand the number of business and dApps in the natuverse**.

### NatuDAO

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are one of the most complex smart contracts. Like other DAOs on the market, the NatuDAO is a tool that provides transparency in the decisions that affect the project. In fact, the NatuDAO will finance and promote projects through a decentralized voting mechanism, so it is crucial to achieve a real decentralization. 

In the Marine era, **our goal is to design the NatuDAO and implement the smart contracts necessary for its operation**.
