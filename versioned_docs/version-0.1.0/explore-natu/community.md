The power of the Natu project relies in its networks. 

The community will constitute a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that will manage funds through decentralized voting events. The development of the community DAO will follow the **[roadmap](/roadmap/overview)**. 


## Advantages of DAOs

- **Decentralization**, because there is no central authority with excessive and unjustified power.
- **Transparency**, because there is a clear decision-making process in which all \$NATU holders can participate.
- **Scalability**, because users can vote to implement functions or finance projects that will grow the ecosystem.

## Challenges for DAOs

- **Provide a clear vision before launching the DAO**. It is crucial to engage the community around a clear goal.
- Generate a **scalable and sustainable reward mechanism** for those who participate in the DAO.
- **Avoid concentration of power** among the participants.
