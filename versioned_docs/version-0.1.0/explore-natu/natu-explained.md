# Natu explained
 
## The problem

Stopping the degradation of the ecosystems is crucial for the economic and social development now and in the future. However, the nature protection is seen as an expense and not an investment. As a result, **[the world has lost a third of its forests ](https://ourworldindata.org/world-lost-one-third-forests)** since the last ice age. Likewise, the overfishing, the water pollution, and the ocean acidification pose a **[risk to marine ecosystems around the world](https://ourworldindata.org/coral-reefs)**.

Therefore, it is necessary to create scalable and sustainable models to stop the degradation of ecosystems around the world. The size of this challenge is huge, so we must involve the society in the search and implementation of solutions. 

## What is Natu?

Natu is a project whose **main purpose is to stop the degradation of ecosystems by creating an open and green digital economy**. Our value proposition opens the door to a new kind of hybrid real state in which the nature protection becomes profitable.

Natu follows a **[roadmap](/roadmap/overview)** to fulfill its promise of value, that is **to build the first and largest hybrid natural park** with the power of technologies such as blockchain, AI, and VR. In fact, we use **blockchain and its smart contracts to create a tamper-resistant and decentralized protocol for monitoring ecosystems around the world**. We also plan to use **\$NATU, as the native and decentralized cryptocurrency** to reward those who carry out a conservation plan. Likewise, Natu uses **machine learning and satellite imagery to help communities meet the conservation goals**. Finally, we use the **monitoring data join with NFTs and virtual reality (VR) to create a metaverse** in which the community can interact in new ways.

## Why to use Natu?

There are several reasons to join the Natu community as a park owner, token holder, or developer.

- As a **park owner**, you will have a **very liquid asset in the crypto market** that generates predictable income over time, according to the **[monetary policy](economics.md)**. **\$NATU is intended to be a means of payment in the Natu ecosystem and its supply is limited to 1,618 bn tokens**.

- As **token holder**, you have a **new green investment asset** that merges the **crypto and game industry joint with ESG investments and real estate**. You also will have a token that is a direct consequence of the conservation of ecosystems. 

- As a **user of the natuverse**, you will be **promoting the decentralization of finances and social networks**. This is because the power of the Natu project is based on its community and not on the control of a central authority.

- As a **scientist, lawyer or developer**, you can **be part of the generation of new standards for the conservation of ecosystems around the world**. In fact, the Natu Improvement Proposals (NIPs) are created and discussed in a transparent and decentralized decision-making process in which the scientific community is invited to take part.

## Natu components

The **[roadmap](/roadmap/overview)** guides the development of the project, but there are some components that are cornerstones for the project. The figure shows an overview of the main components of Natu.  

![Components of Natu.](/img/natu-explained.png)

### Natu conservation network

All park owners, communities and institutions that carry out conservation plans in their domains take part in the Natu conservation network. They commit to follow conservation standards in exchange for \$NATU, according to the **[monetary policy](economics.md)**.

### Monitoring protocol

The **[monitoring protocol](monitoring.md) is a set of smart contracts that manage a registry with the conservation history of parks in the network**. The registry is tamper-proof because of the use of cryptography and its results allows the monetary expansion of \$NATU. 

### Monetary policy

The **[monetary policy](economics.md) provide a scalable and sustainable mechanism to reward those who conserve the nature in their domains**. The monetary policy is based on the token \$NATU.

### NatuDAO

The power of Natu lies in its networks, and natuDAO is a suitable tool for community empowerment. **[NatuDAO](natudao.md) is a decentralized autonomous organization that manages funds through decentralized voting events**. In fact, \$NATU holders can vote to implement new features or finance projects that will grow the ecosystem.

### Natuverse

The **[natuverse](natuverse.md)** is intended to be the **first and largest hybrid natural park**. The natuverse runs on the **[NEAR blockchain](https://near.org/)** and occupies \$NATU as the native currency.

The natuverse is conceived as a place where the community can interact in new ways. Likewise, **developers can create new business models that run on top of the natuverse**.

The natuverse is one of the cornerstones for creating a new green, decentralized, and open economy.
