# Natu explained
 
## The problem

Stopping the degradation of the ecosystems is crucial for the economic and social development now and in the future. However, the nature protection is seen as an expense and not an investment. As a result, **[the world has lost a third of its forests ](https://ourworldindata.org/world-lost-one-third-forests)** since the last ice age. Likewise, the overfishing, the water pollution, and the ocean acidification pose a **[risk to marine ecosystems around the world](https://ourworldindata.org/coral-reefs)**.

Therefore, it is necessary to create scalable and sustainable models to stop the degradation of ecosystems around the world. The size of this challenge is huge, so we must involve the society in the search and implementation of solutions. 

## What is Natu?

Natu aims **to build the first and largest hybrid natural park** with the power of technologies such as blockchain and machine learning. In fact, we use **blockchain and its smart contracts to create a tamper-resistant and decentralized protocol for monitoring ecosystems around the world**. We also plan to use **\$NATU, as the native and decentralized cryptocurrency** to reward those who carry out a conservation plan. Likewise, Natu uses **machine learning and satellite imagery to help communities to meet conservation goals**.

Our value proposition opens the door to a new kind of hybrid real state in which the nature protection becomes profitable.


## Why to use Natu?

There are several reasons to join the Natu community as a park owner, token holder, or developer.

- As a **park owner**, you will have a **very liquid asset in the crypto market** that generates predictable income over time, according to the **[natunomics](natunomics)**.

- As **token holder**, you have a **new green investment asset** that merges the **crypto and game industry joint with ESG investments and real estate**. You also will have a token that is a direct consequence of the conservation of ecosystems. 

- As a **scientist, lawyer or developer**, you can **be part of the generation of new standards for the conservation of ecosystems around the world**. In fact, the Natu Improvement Proposals (NIPs) are created and discussed in a transparent and decentralized decision-making process in which the scientific community is invited to take part.

## Natu components

The **[roadmap](/roadmap/overview)** guides the development of the project, but there are some components that are cornerstones for the project. The figure shows an overview of the main components of Natu.  

![Components of Natu.](/img/natu-explained.png)

### Natu conservation network

All park owners, communities and institutions that carry out conservation plans in their domains take part in the Natu conservation network. **They commit to follow conservation standards in exchange for \$NATU**, according to the **[natunomics](natunomics)**.

### Monitoring protocol

The **[monitoring protocol](monitoring) is a set of smart contracts that manage a registry with the conservation history of parks in the network**. The registry is tamper-proof because of the use of cryptography and its results allows the monetary expansion of \$NATU. 

### Natunomics

The **[natunomics](natunomics)** is based on a **protect to earn (P2E)** principle that distributes rewards to the park owners. These **rewards are paid in \$NATU** a fungible token in the **[NEAR blockchain](https://near.org/)**.

### Natu Improvement Proposals (NIPs)

NIPs play a central role in the development of Natu. **They are the space for the community to propose, discuss and adopt changes**. Each NIP contains a technical spec and a rationale for the proposed new feature. There are different types of NIPs that can include the addition of new features or the adoption of new standards for conservation, among others. 

NIPs will be available soon in the site **nips.natu.tech**

### NatuDAO

The power of Natu lies in its networks, and natuDAO is a suitable tool for community empowerment. **NatuDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that manages funds through decentralized voting events**. In fact, $NATU holders can vote to finance and promote projects that can grow the Natu ecosystem.

NatuDAO will be available soon in the site **dao.natu.tech**
