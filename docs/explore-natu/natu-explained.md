# Natu explained
 
## The problem

Stopping the degradation of the ecosystems is crucial for the economic and social development now and in the future. However, the nature protection is seen as an expense and not an investment. As a result, **[the world has lost a third of its forests ](https://ourworldindata.org/world-lost-one-third-forests)** since the last ice age. Likewise, the overfishing, the water pollution, and the ocean acidification pose a **[risk to marine ecosystems around the world](https://ourworldindata.org/coral-reefs)**.

Therefore, it is necessary to create scalable and sustainable models to stop the degradation of ecosystems around the world. The size of this challenge is huge, so we must involve the society in the search and implementation of solutions. 


## What is Natu?

Natu is a project whose **main purpose is to stop the degradation of ecosystems by creating an open and green digital economy**. 

Natu follows a **[roadmap](/roadmap/overview)** to fulfill its promise of value, that is **to build the first and largest natural park on the web3** with the power of technologies such as blockchain, AI, VR, and AR. In fact, we use **blockchain and its smart contracts to create a tamper-resistant and decentralized protocol for monitoring ecosystems around the world**. We also plan to use **\$NATU, as the native and decentralized cryptocurrency** to reward those who carry out a conservation plan. Likewise, Natu uses **machine learning and satellite imagery to help communities meet the conservation goals**. Finally, we use the **monitoring data join with NFTs and virtual reality (VR) to create a metaverse** in which the community can interact in new ways.

## Why to use Natu?

There are several reasons to join the Natu community as a landowners, \$NATU holder, or developer.

- As a **landowner**, you will have a **very liquid asset in the crypto market** that generates predictable income over time, according to the **[monetary policy](economics.md)**. **\$NATU is intended to be a means of payment in the NatuChain**. Its supply is limited to 1,618 bn tokens.

- As **\$NATU holder**, you have a **new green investment asset** that merges the **crypto and game industry joint with ESG investments and real estate**. You also will have a coin that is a direct consequence of the conservation of ecosystems. 

- As a **user of the natuverse**, you will be **promoting the decentralization of finances and social networks**. This is because the power of the Natu project is based on its community and not on the control of a central authority.

- As a **scientist, lawyer or developer**, you can **be part of the generation of new standards for the conservation of ecosystems around the world**. In fact, the Natu Improvement Proposals (NIPs) are created and discussed in a transparent and decentralized decision-making process in which the scientific community is invited to take part.

## Natu components

The **[roadmap](/roadmap/overview)** guides the development of the project, but there are some components that are cornerstones for the project. See the figure in **[what is natu?](#what-is-natu)** for an overview of the components of Natu.  


### Natu conservation network

All landowners, communities and institutions that carry out conservation plans in their domains take part in the Natu network. They commit to follow Natuâ€™s conservation standards in exchange for \$NATU, according to the **[monetary policy](economics.md)**.

### Monitoring protocol

The **monitoring protocol is a set of smart contracts that manage a registry with the conservation history of parks in the network**. The registry is tamper-proof because of the use of cryptography and its results allows the monetary expansion of \$NATU, the native currency for the NatuChain. 

### Monetary policy

The **[monetary policy](economics.md) provide a scalable and sustainable mechanism to reward those who conserve the nature in their domains**. The monetary policy is based on the cryptocurrency \$NATU.

### Software development kit (SDK)

Natu provides a **set of tools that can be connected to the dApps developed in the NatuChain**. 

### Natuverse

The natuverse is intended to be the **first and largest natural park on the web3**. The natuverse runs on NatuChain and occupies \$NATU as the native currency.

The natuverse is conceived as a place where the community can interact in new ways. Likewise, **developers can create new business models using the sdk**.

The natuverse is one of the cornerstones for creating a new green and open economy.

### NatuChain

The NatuChain is a crucial part of Natu proposal of value. It is a blockchain conceived for supporting the development of the metaverse. 

**Its design will be discussed at Tundra era**, but we will focus in energy efficiency, decentralization, scalability, and security. We also will design the NatuChain for process complex operations in a decentralized manner. Two examples are the renderization (to create a decentralized GPU), and artificial intelligence (to create a decentralizes TPU).
