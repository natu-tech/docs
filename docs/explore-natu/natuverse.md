# Welcome to the Natuverse


### What is the natuverse?

**The Natuverse aims to be the world's first and largest hybrid nature park**. It forms part of the core of Natu's value proposition.

The hybrid nature of the natuverse is based on the fact that all parks in the Natu conservation network (in the real world) are included in this new virtual world. **Park guardians are therefore part of the backbone of a new open and green economy that Natu aims to create.**


### Why to use the natuverse?

One of the main challenges for Natu is to make the protection of ecosystems profitable in a free market. **The answer is in the metaverse**.

By creating a metaverse with the parks in the conservation network, park owners and the users have a means of transferring value back and forth. To this end, we use a fungible token called $NATU as the native and decentralized form of money in the metaverse. Here, the monetary expansion of \$NATU is a direct consequence of meeting conservation goals. Thus, **the users can be sure that all the parks in the natuverse are being protected**. 

By its part, the **park owners have a new liquid asset that makes the protection of the nature profitable in the long run**. In fact, Natu offers several new opportunities in the new hybrid real estate market.


## Main components

The natuverse aims to be a safe and open place where the community can interact in new ways while supporting the protection of ecosystems. It is made up of some basic components that serve as a platform to develop new business models on it. 


### Conservation Unit (COUN)

**[Conservation units](monitoring.md#conservation-units)** (COUNs) are **[NEP-171](https://nomicon.io/Standards/NonFungibleToken/Core.html)** NFTs that represent a square of one hectare of parks in the real world. Its owners are the first receiver of new minted \$NATU, according to the economics. Here, the minimum viable park is made up of 3 adjoining COUNs which drastically reduces the barriers to entry compared to other solutions such as **[carbon credits](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/carbon_credit.asp)**. 

**COUNs are the link between the real world and the virtual one**. So park owners in the real world have special benefits in exchange of their long-term commitment with nature conservation. In fact, although COUNs are tradable, **park owners will receive the 10% of the rewards and the future sales**.

The parks in the natuverse are built by using the monitoring data, so **their representation is dynamic**. In fact, the current weather conditions will be included and the parks will look different in each season of the year.


### Towns

**Every time 1,000,000 new COUNs are incorporated, a new synthetic town of 1,618 hectares is created.** This towns are made up of virtual real estate properties of 0,5 hectares called LANDs. **These LANDS are tradable and can be used for buildings and rent, among others**. Also, the LANDs grant their owners a vote in the internal democracy of the town.


### Chalets

**Every time a new 1,000 hectares are added, a new chalet appears in a random place in the natuverse**. These properties are tradable and can have marketplaces where users can shop in the middle of the parks.

### Avatars

**Users are represented by unique and irreplaceable avatars using NFTs**. In the natuverse, users can have as many skins as they have combinations of NFTs. Therefore, we expect users to purchase verified NFTs directly from brands and creators. 

From the gaming side, NFTs can also give you additional abilities, like flying, running faster, or teleporting.

## Challenges for the natuverse


Below we present some challenges for the project in the short, medium and long term.

- Help communities to meet their conservation goals.
- Prevent threats such as fires, illegal logging and pests through the use of cutting-edge technology.
- Increase adoption by incorporating new users but also companies and brands.
- Decentralize access to hardware, so that device acquisition costs are lower and adoption increases.
- Use or provide a fully decentralized identity solution to protect users.
- Provide good development tools to companies or people who want to develop their business in the natuverse.
- Achieve the long-term commitment of park owners by generating a robust system of incentives.
