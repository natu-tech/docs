# Biome

![Biome era](/img/biome.png)


The main milestone of the Biome era is to have **100,000 conservation units in the conservation network**. So the team will focus on scaling the ecosystem by launching the natuverse in the NEAR mainnet, developing a SDK, adding new features, and promoting the adoption.

## Biome work scope

### Natu conservation network

In the Biome era, the **team will focus on joining new parks around the world**. This poses the challenge of dealing in many different jurisdictions, so Natu will promote alliances to address these potential risks.

At this point we expect to be one of the most distributed, decentralized and largest conservation networks in the world.

### Natuverse

In the Biome era **our goal is to launch the natuverse in the NEAR mainnet**. This must include a NFT marketplace in the first cryptown, so the team will develop the functionality to make the natuverse usable.

At the same time, the team will develop all the functions to make the natuverse a serious player in the market.

### Natu SDK

It is time to promote and integrate the first dApps in the natuverse. This is a crucial moment for the project because great usability means great adoption in the future.

In the Marine era **our goal is to develop a software development kit (sdk) that enables developers to easily create and deploy their dApps**. 

In this era the team will focus on **incorporating new features to the natuverse**. 

There are two crucial aspects to have a secure and competitive metaverse. First, **we need to use decentralized identity solutions** and the team will work on provide this. Second, **we need to decentralize the hardware** so the costs decreases due to the competence and the adoption increases.

### Next roadmap

The Biome era is just the beginning of the project. **Natu will establish the next stages of the roadmap through chain voting events**.

At this point we expect to be one of the largest and most decentralized networks in the cryptospace.
