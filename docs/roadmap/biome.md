# Biome

![Biome era](/img/biome.png)


The main milestone of this era is the to achieve 1,000,000 of conservation units in the conservation network. So the team will focus on scaling the ecosystem by improving the SDK, adding new features, and promoting the adoption.


## Biome work scope

### Natu conservation network

In the Biome era, the **team will focus on joining new parks around the world**. This poses the challenge of dealing in many different jurisdictions, so Natu will promote alliances to address these potential risks.

At this point we expect to be one of the most distributed, decentralized and largest conservation networks in the world.

### Core protocol

In this era the team will focus on **incorporating new features to the metaverse**. There are two crucial aspects to have a secure and competitive metaverse. First, **we need to use decentralized identity solutions** and the team will work on provide this. Second, **we need to decentralize the hardware** so the costs decreases due to the competence and the adoption increases.

### Next roadmap

The Biome era is just the beginning of the project. **Natu will establish the next stages of the roadmap through chain voting events**.

At this point we expect to be one of the largest and most decentralized networks in the cryptospace.
