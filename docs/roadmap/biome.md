# Biome

![Biome era](/img/biome.png)


The main milestone of this era is the release of the first stable version of NatuChain. After the launch, the team will focus on scaling the ecosystem by improving the SDK, adding new features, and promoting the adoption.


## Biome work scope

### Natu conservation network

In the Biome era, the **team will focus on joining new parks around the world**. This poses the challenge of dealing in many different jurisdictions, so Natu will promote alliances to address these potential risks.

At this point we expect to be one of the most distributed, decentralized and largest conservation networks in the world.

### Core protocol

From a technical point of view, the team will focus on generating a set of decentralized services that can be connected to the dApps. The idea is to have access to decentralized processing units (like GPU or TPU).

In the Biome era, **our goal is to create at least one decentralized service for dApps**. Also, we aim to **implement a native payment gateway** for real-world businesses to increase adoption.

### Next roadmap

The Biome era is just the beginning of the project. **Natu will establish the next stages of the roadmap through chain voting events**.

At this point we expect to be one of the largest and most decentralized networks in the cryptospace.
