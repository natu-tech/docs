# Tundra

![Tundra era](/img/tundra.png)

The first era **is entirely to establish the foundations of Natu**. Therefore, the research and development will focus on preparing Natu for the future stages. This includes the creation of the Natu conservation network by joining the first parks in Chile. The team also will work on the creation of the smart contracts.

## Tundra work scope

### Natu conservation network

The Natu conservation network starts here. Our goal is **to integrate the first parks into the network for testing purposes**. In the Tundra era we will focus on terrestrial ecosystems in Chile, such as temperate rainforest or patagonian steppe.

### Natu Improvement Proposals

The Natu Improvement Proposals (NIPs) describe the standards for Natu, including protocols for the conservation of ecosystems, client APIs, among others.

We conceive NIPs as an open space in which scientists, lawyers, and developers can collaborate in order to provide high quality standards for the project.

At the Tundra era, **our goal is to establish a clear decision-making process for creating NIPs**. Also, we intend to create the first standards.

### Natu core protocol

In the Tundra era **our goal is to implement the smart contracts for minting the conservation units and the \$NATU token in the NEAR blockchain**. The team will also work on the development of the monitoring protocol, which involves the creation of an API connected to the blockchain through an oracle in Chainlink.

### Adoption strategy

**We will create our crypto 101 course** to introduce the world of cryptocurrencies to the community. The course will have two versions, one for potential users and one for park owners.

We will also initiate a social media strategy for brand positioning on twitter, linkedin and instagram.
