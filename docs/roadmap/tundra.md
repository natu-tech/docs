# Tundra

![Tundra era](/img/tundra.png)

The first era **is entirely to establish the foundations of Natu**. So the research and development will be focused in preparing Natu for the future stages. We also will create the Natu conservation network by joining the first parks in Chile.

## Tundra work scope

### Natu conservation network

The Natu conservation network starts here. Our goal is **to integrate the first parks into the network for testing purposes**. In the Tundra era we will focus on terrestrial ecosystems in Chile, such as temperate rainforest or patagonian steppe.

### Natu Improvement Proposals

The Natu Improvement Proposals (NIPs) describe the standards for Natu, including protocols for the conservation of ecosystems, client APIs, among others.

We conceive NIPs as an open space in which scientists, lawyers, and developers can collaborate in order to provide high quality standards for the project.

At the Tundra era, **our goal is to establish a clear decision-making process for creating NIPs**. Also, we intend to create the first two standards. The first to classify the risk associated with each park in the network, and the second to establish the necessary data for the construction of the metaverse.

#### Natu core protocol

In the era of the Tundra **our goal is to implement the smart contracts for minting the conservation units and the \$NATU token in the NEAR testnet**. 

To achieve a correct functioning, we have to create an external API for monitoring ecosystems (according to NIPs) and integrate this with the smart contracts by using oracles in Chainlink.

### Natuverse

In the Tundra era **our goal is to create the first demo of the natuverse**. The demo is expected to be simple, but users will be allowed to create their avatars and walk through the first few parks. For the demo we expect to use unreal engine to have realistic renders.
