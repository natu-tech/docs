# Marine

![Marine era](/img/marine.png)

At this point, the natuverse is in its early stages and there are few parks in the network. So in the Marine era **our goal is to integrate as many parks as possible to achieve true decentralization**. This era also involves the creation of the community DAO and the first demo of the natuverse.


## Marine work scope

### Natu conservation network

At this moment there are some parks in the network that are being rewarded with \$NATU. Is the time to create a business case for onboarding institutional investors. DG Loans appears as a good instrument for this purpose.

In the Marine era, **our objective is to continue incorporating private park owners and communities, but also institutional investors**.

### NatuDAO

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are one of the most complex smart contracts. Like other DAOs on the market, the NatuDAO is a tool that provides transparency in the decisions that affect the project. In fact, the NatuDAO will finance and promote projects through a decentralized voting mechanism, so it is crucial to achieve a real decentralization. 

In the Marine era, **our goal is to design the NatuDAO and implement the smart contracts necessary for its operation**.


### Natuverse

In the Marine era **our goal is to create the first demo of the natuverse**. The demo is expected to be simple, but users will be allowed to create their avatars and walk through the first hybrid parks. For the demo we expect to use unreal engine to have realistic renders.

### Adoption strategy
**We will be creating a metaverse 101 course** to teach the community how to take full advantage of the benefits of the natuverse. The course will have two versions, one for potential users and one for park owners.
